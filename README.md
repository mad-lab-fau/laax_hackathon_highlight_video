# Laax Hackathon Highlight Video
Create a highlight video by combining IMU and video data using an air event detection algorithm. The air event detection algorithm detects windows with low frequencies in the acceleration signal.

## Usage
We created a pycharm project within the python folder. Next to the python folder, we placed an data folder in the repository, which is ignored (gitignore). Within the data folder, we have folders named "session1", "session2"... Also there is a music folder in the data folder containing the music file boom.mp3.

The python dependencies are stored in the requirements.txt file. This file can be used to automatically generate an identical python distribution. Only the version of python itself has to be at least 3.5 (I think Jenny's was higher).

If everything is set up correctly, you can run the "final_script.py" file. 

The individual python packages in the utilities folder are not very well structured, but at least more or less well documented.
